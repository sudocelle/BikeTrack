# BikeTrack 🚲📍

**BikeTrack** is a proof-of-concept IoT bicycle security and tracking system, simulated using Proteus and connected to a custom-built Android app.

The system demonstrates how GPS data and RFID-based locking mechanisms can be integrated with wireless communication (ESP8266 simulation) to enhance bicycle safety and monitoring.

## 🔧 Features
- 🚴 Real-time GPS location updates (simulated)
- 🔐 RFID-based unlock system
- 🌐 ESP8266 (Wi-Fi) module simulation for data transfer
- 📱 Android app UI for live tracking and lock control
- 🔌 Serial communication between Proteus and Python to relay data

---

## 📦 Tech Stack
- **Proteus 8.5** – Circuit simulation
- **Arduino** – RFID, GPS logic
- **ESP8266 (simulated)** – Wi-Fi bridge
- **Python** – Serial-to-socket bridge for Android app
- **Android Studio (Java/Kotlin)** – Frontend map and controls
