-inside build folder, find the hex file
-the hex file is the compiled binary file that will be used as the programmable file i the proteus simulation-this can be seen on the microcontroller used
-in this case, we used Arduino ATMEGA 2560
-make sure that the microcontroller used in the .ino file is similar to the one used in the simulation
-the use of esp8266 will be simulated using the python file.
